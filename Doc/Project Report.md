## Overview 

The Recycling Tracker app allows users to log the items that they recycle on a weekly basis in order to measure the impact their recycling habits have on the environment. It allows users to view their recycling trends over time and gain valuable insights into the types of materials they are recycling.

## Related Work

There are several apps that tackle a similar issue, each from a slightly different angle. Many focus on recycling done at the enterprise level rather than being aimed at individuals looking to measure their personal impact. Some of the notable ones are the EPA's ReCon tool, Klima, and Adva. Many of these apps look at the larger role recycling plays in an individual's carbon footprint, which is the eventual goal of this application. However, this iteration of the app focuses solely on recycling as a key component in one's overall carbon footprint. By logging individual recyclable items, my app will aim to track those data points on a daily and weekly basis, giving a more granular view of impact over time and help to educate users on what materials can and can't be recycled.

## Updates in Current Iteration

The fundamental logic for the app has mostly been implemented in this sprint. The updates include the following:

- Added Recyclables Screen for logging individual items, Recycling Bin screen which functions like a shopping cart to store currently selected recyclables, and a Stats screen to display lifetime totals. These were implemented using Jetpack Compose and a Scaffold layout with bottom navigation. It currently uses placeholder icons for each item. UI will be fleshed out and designed in future iteration.

  - The Bin Summary page uses a floating action button for submitting current bin to the Firestore database. Each entry contains a map of items and their quanitites, along with a date stamp.

- Implemented a ViewModel to store current item counts, as well as to handle database access.

- Implemented Cloud Firestore database to track entries and totals. Project data layer contains a DAO and Repository, which are used by the ViewModel to access the database using coroutines in Android. More detailed information in the Database Structure section below.


## Requirement Analysis and Testing 

|Title|Create Account (Essential)|
|---|---|
|Description|As a user, I want to create a user account to record my recycling habits and view my impact data over time.  |
|Mockups||
|Acceptance Tests|The user will create an account with a username and password. They will then be prompted to provide some basic information, which will then be stored in their profile page for future viewing and editing.|
|Test Results| |
|Status||)* 

|Title|View Material Categories (Essential)|
|---|---|
|Description|As a user, I want to be able to start by viewing recycling categories by material so that I can find each items quickly. |
|Mockups||
|Acceptance Tests|The user will be presented with cards for each of the main material categories: Cardboard, Glass, Plastic, Paper, etc. When they select a material, they will see a grid of icons showing common recyclabes in that category. They will then select items by tapping on the icons and increasing the count, much like a shopping cart. 
|Test Results| |
|Status||)* 

|Title|Build a Recycling "Bin" (Essential)|
|---|---|
|Description|As a user, I need to be able to select the items I am recycling from the grid of common recyclable items |
|Mockups||
|Acceptance Tests|The user will then select items by tapping on the icons and increasing the count, much like a shopping cart. These items will be added to a bin object, which contains a time and date stamp. When ready, the user can submit those items, and they will be logged and added to their overall total of recycled materials.|
|Test Results| |
|Status||)* 

|Title|Edit Date of Already Submitted Bin (Desirable)|
|---|---|
|Description|As a user, I need to be able to edit the date of a previously submitted bin in order to make corrections or adjustments |
|Mockups||
|Acceptance Tests|The user can view their recycling history organized by bins (individual submissions). They need to be able to easily edit the data contained in this bin object and have it reflected in the database and update their totals accordingly.|
|Test Results| |
|Status||)* 

|Title|View weekly, monthly, and yearly summary (Desirable)|
|---|---|
|Description|As a user, I want to have visual representations (graphs, charts, etc.) that summarize my overall recycling progress and how those habits have impacted the environment. |
|Mockups||
|Acceptance Tests|Click on the summary tab and click “yearly” to view pie chart and overall carbon reduction.|
|Test Results| |
|Status||)* 

|Title|Receive Feedback that Bin Has Been Submitted to Database (Desirable)|
|---|---|
|Description|As a user, I want to receive a confirmation message that my items have been logged successfully. |
|Mockups||
|Acceptance Tests|After submitting bin, receive a message showing the bin summary and whether it was successfully uploaded or not.|
|Test Results| |
|Status||)* 

|Title|View Trends (Desirable)|
|---|---|
|Description|As a user, I want to view how my carbon footprint has increased or decreased over time as feedback on my recycling habits.|
|Mockups||
|Acceptance Tests|Under the summary tab, the user clicks the “Trends” button to display a line graph showing their carbon emissions over time.|
|Test Results| |
|Status||)* 

|Title|View Material Breakdown (Desirable)|
|---|---|
|Description|As a user, I want to view a pie chart of my recycled items to date broken down by material and overall weight (e.g. "This year you've recycled 50lbs of plastic"), so that I can get a sense of my long term impact.|
|Mockups||
|Acceptance Tests|Under the summary tab, user will be presented with a pie chart that pulls from the database total amounts and separatees them by material. It will also total the approximate weight in each category.|
|Test Results| |
|Status||)* 

|Title|View Offset Information Based on Totals (Desirable)|
|---|---|
|Description|As a user, along with the totals of each material weight, I want to view exmamples of the types of emissions that could possibly be offset by those amounts, so that I can see a direct benefit of the recycling I have done.|
|Mockups||
|Acceptance Tests|Along with the approximate weights of each material type, the user will receive one or more "impact statements" along the lines of "That is the equivalent of X number of car trips" in order to draw a parallel between recycling and overall carbon footprint|
|Test Results| |
|Status||)* 

|Title|Receive Recommendations (Desirable)|
|---|---|
|Description|As a user, I want to be able to receive personalized recommendations from the app for how I can reduce my carbon footprint.|
|Mockups||

|Mockups||
|Acceptance Tests|At the end of each week, the user will receive a summary page outlining their progress throughout the week.|
|Test Results| |
|Status||)* 

## Design and Implementation

- App will use a single activity with composables and use ViewModel to manage state
- IAM will be handled using Firebase
- User profile data will be stored in Google Cloud Firestore, a NoSQL database
- One of the desired features is to use location services to show the user the average carbon footprint in their area and how they compare

### Wireframes

### Early UI

Current UI assets are placeholders and are intended only to test the underlying logic. Icons may be replaced with stock photos, and pie chart colors will be updated to reflect app design pallette.
